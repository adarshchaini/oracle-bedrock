Release Numbers
---------------

Release numbers for the Oracle Tools are represented as three
separate numbers, each separated by a full-stop in the form `x.y.z` where by
the meaning of the individual numbers in the release number is as follows:

**x**:  Changes in this number represents a major or new generation of the that
of which introduces new functionality or removes previous functionality.

In most cases, especially those where functionality is removed, maintaining complete
backwards compatibility between releases is unlikely or impossible.

**y**:  Changes in this number represents a minor upgrade.

Such releases typically introduce some new functionality, perform some refactoring
and/or deprecate (but not remove) existing functionality.

Sometimes these changes may break some backwards compatibility. 

**z**:  Changes in this number represents a patch or fix release.

Such releases should never break backwards compatibility.  Typically these are used
for documentation and non-breaking dependency upgrades.
