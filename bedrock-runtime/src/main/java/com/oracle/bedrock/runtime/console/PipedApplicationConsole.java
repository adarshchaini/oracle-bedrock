/**
 * An {@link ApplicationConsole} pipes all output to
 * appropriate readers and all input to appropriate writers.
 * <p>
 * A {link PipedApplicationConsole} uses {@link java.io.PipedWriter}s and
 * {@link java.io.PipedReader}s to read from and write to an
 * {@link Application}'s streams. These pipes have a
 * fixed size, which defaults to 1024 bytes and is configurable using a constructor
 * parameter. If the number of bytes written to stdout or stderr by the application
 * exceeds the size of the pipe then no more output will be written to the pipes until
 * space is made available by reading from the other end of the pipe; that is, by
 * reading from this {@link PipedApplicationConsole}'s OutputReader or ErrorReader.
 * </p>
 * <b>Note:</b> If attempting to read from this {@link PipedApplicationConsole}'s
 * OutputReader or ErrorReader after the underlying {@link Application}
 * has been closed then this {@link PipedApplicationConsole} should be closed first as this
 * will then properly close the pipes and avoid exceptions being thrown due to the {@link Thread}
 * writing to the pipe's having terminated.
